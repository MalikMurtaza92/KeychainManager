do {
    if let password = try KeychainManager.shared.retrieveCredential(account: "user_account") {
        print("Password: \(password)")
    }
} catch {
    print("Failed to retrieve credentials: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```
#### Updating Credentials
```swift 
do {
    try KeychainManager.shared.updateCredential(account: "user_account", password: "new_password")
} catch {
    print("Failed to update credentials: \(error.localizedDescription)")

# How to Import Code Snippet into Xcode

1. Open Xcode.
2. Go to the Code Snippet Library by pressing `Shift + Command + L`.
3. Drag the `.codesnippet` file into the code snippet area in Xcode.

Alternatively, you can manually add the snippet:

1. Highlight the code you want to save as a snippet in Xcode.
2. Drag the highlighted code into the snippet library.
3. Add a Title, Summary, and Completion Shortcut for quick use in your code.

## Error Handling

The `KeychainManager` uses the `KeychainError` enum to handle different error cases:

- `itemNotFound`: When the requested item is not found in Keychain.
- `serviceError`: Communication issues with Keychain.
- `conversionError`: Data conversion issues from Keychain to the required format.
- `badData`: Corrupted or invalid data retrieved from Keychain.

```swift
do {
    try KeychainManager.shared.storeCredential(account: "user_account", password: "user_password")
} catch KeychainError.itemNotFound {
    print("Item not found.")
} catch {
    print("An error occurred: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

## Conclusion

The `KeychainManager.swift` offers a simple and secure way to manage credentials in your iOS apps. Whether youâ€™re saving, updating, or retrieving sensitive data, this utility makes it straightforward while handling errors gracefully.

For developers, this code snippet is also available in Xcode for easy integration into any project.
